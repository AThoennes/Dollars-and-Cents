# Dollars and Cents

This program asks the user to enter a number of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. It then calculates the amount of money you have in US dollars. This was my second assignment for my CMPS class. The intention of this program was to introduce us to the reserved word final as well as the modulous (%) function.
